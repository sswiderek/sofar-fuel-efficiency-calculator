After analyzing the chat history and codebase, I can see that the mobile tooltip issue persists because the Radix UI Tooltip component requires specific configuration for touch devices. Let's fix this by implementing a custom hook for touch device detection and updating the tooltip configuration:

client/src/hooks/use-touch-device.ts
client/src/components/results-display.tsx
client/src/index.css
pkill -f node && npm run dev

The error EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:5000 means there's already a process running on port 5000. This happens when the server didn't shut down properly from a previous run. Let's kill the existing process and restart the server:

pkill -f "tsx server/index.ts" && npm run dev
Regarding the mobile tooltips, I see we need to adjust a few things. Let's update the tooltip configuration:

Yes, this error indicates that port 5000 is already in use, which means another instance of your server is still running. This can prevent new changes from being applied since the new server instance can't start.

Let's kill the existing process and restart. Here's how:

pkill -f "node"
After this command completes, try clicking the Run button again to start a fresh instance of your server. This should allow your changes to take effect.

Based on the codebase, I notice you're using the useTouchDevice hook to detect mobile devices. Let's modify the tooltip implementation to work better on touch devices by adjusting the delay duration and ensuring touch events are handled properly.

client/src/components/results-display.tsx
client/src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx
These changes:

Add a larger side offset for better positioning on mobile

I notice that the server is already running on port 5000 and preventing a new instance from starting. Let's kill the existing process:

lsof -i :5000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
After this, you can restart the server with the Run button. This command finds and terminates any process listening on port 5000.

I see the server is already running on port 5000 and needs to be killed first. Let's do that:

pkill -f "tsx server/index.ts"
Now let's start the server:

npm run dev
This will start the server using the npm script defined in package.json which runs tsx server/index.ts. The server will be accessible on port 5000.

why is nothing showing in my console view if my app appears in the webview?

SS

Based on the logs I can see in the workflows state, your server is actually running and logging output, but the Console view may not be showing it. Here are a few things to try:

Click the "Clear History" button in the Console view to reset it
Make sure "Show Only Latest" is turned off (the toggle in your Console view)
If you still don't see output, let's restart the server with more verbose logging:

pkill -f "node"
DEBUG=express:* npm run dev
This will show more detailed Express server logs in the Console. The server is definitely running since your webview is working and making successful API calls - we just need to make the logs visible in the Console view.

The "Error: Exited with: 1" typically indicates that the server process crashed or was terminated with an error code 1. Looking at your logs, I can see the server lost connection:

["[vite] server connection lost. Polling for restart..."]
Let's kill any existing Node.js processes and restart the server:

pkill -f "node"
Now let's restart the server:

Every time we make an edit together, I see this "Exited with: 1" text appear in our chat. This seems problematic. What is the root of the issue and could it be causing our bigger problem of getting the tooltips fixed on mobile?

SS

sswiderek
Assistant
13 hours ago
Looking at the logs and error message, there are two separate issues:

The "Exited with: 1" error is happening because the server is failing to start with an EADDRINUSE error on port 5000. This means the previous server process is still running when we try to start a new one after making changes. This isn't directly related to the tooltip issue, but we should fix it.

The tooltip mobile issues are purely frontend-related and are caused by the touch event handling we tried to implement.

Let's fix the server issue first:

pkill -f "node"
This will kill any hanging Node processes. Then we can start the server again:

npm run dev
For the tooltip mobile issue, let's try a different approach with the tooltip component:

client/src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx
The tooltip should now work better on mobile by letting the native touch handling take over instead of our custom implementation. If you continue seeing the "Exited with: 1" message after changes, just run the pkill command again before starting the server.

Tooltips still aren't working on mobile. What do our debugging logs say

SS

sswiderek
Assistant
13 hours ago
Looking at the webview logs, I notice there are multiple Vite hot updates and connection attempts, but nothing specifically indicating tooltip errors. However, the server logs show normal API activity.

Based on the codebase, I can see we have a mobile detection hook use-mobile.tsx but we aren't leveraging it for the tooltips. The tooltip issue on mobile is likely related to touch events not being handled properly.

Let's modify the tooltip component to better handle mobile interactions:

client/src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx
Improve mobile tooltip support
This change:

Detects mobile devices using touch capability
Disables hoverable content on mobile (which can cause stuck tooltips)

Looking at our attempts so far, I notice we've been focusing on modifying the tooltip component directly, but haven't properly considered the interaction between touch events and the tooltip trigger. Let's try a different approach using the useTouchDevice hook we already have and implementing a modal-like behavior for mobile.

SS

Ah, I see the issue. Testing in the webview on your phone isn't the same as testing on an actual mobile browser - the webview might not properly simulate touch events. For proper mobile testing, you should deploy your app and test it on your phone's browser.

Let's modify the tooltip implementation to work better with touch events. Here's a more reliable approach:

client/src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx
Let's also update the ResultsDisplay component to handle the tooltip state:

client/src/components/results-display.tsx
After applying these changes, I recommend:

Deploy your app
Test it on your actual mobile browser rather than the webview
Try tapping the info icons - they should now show/hide the tooltips on touch
Deployments
Publish a live, stable, public version of your App, unaffected by the changes you make in the workspace.

The error you're seeing is related to the favicon.ico file not being found, which is causing a 500 server error. Let's fix this by adding a proper favicon to your project.

public/favicon.ico
client/index.html
This should resolve the favicon 500 error. The preventDefault errors you're seeing appear to be related to touch events, but they're not causing any functional issues - they're just warnings about event handling in development mode.

SS

sswiderek
Assistant

Yes, to see the changes working properly on a real mobile device, you should deploy a new version to test in the production environment. The webview in Replit may not fully simulate all mobile behaviors.

Let me guide you:

Click on the "Deployment" tool in the sidebar
Deploy your latest changes
Once deployed, access your app's production URL on your mobile device's browser
Deployments
Publish a live, stable, public version of your App, unaffected by the changes you make in the workspace.
This will give you the most accurate testing environment for mobile interactions.

I'm still getting this error when I "tap" on it in my mobile emulator in chrome devtoolss emulation feature.

What does this tell you. Can we add some debugging to get you more helpful information so you know exactly what to do? Or do you have enough with this already? Help me help you.

Looking at the error, it seems we have a preventDefault issue in the touch event handling. Let's add some debugging logs to better understand what's happening when the tooltip is triggered on mobile.

client/src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx
After applying these changes, check the browser's console while testing on the mobile emulator. This will help us see exactly which events are firing and in what order. The error suggests there might be a conflict in event handling, so I've:

Removed the preventDefault() call that was causing issues
Added explicit touch event handlers
Added console logging for debugging
Let me know what you see in the console logs when testing, and we can further refine the solution based on that information.

There's a preventDefault issue in the touch event handling
To get more detailed logs, you should:

Check the Network tab in your browser's dev tools to see all HTTP requests
Look at the server logs in your Replit console (where npm run dev is running)
Enable more verbose console logging in the tooltip component
Let's add more detailed logging to help debug the touch events:

The issue is that our current logging approach with console.log isn't providing enough detail about the touch events. Let's enhance the logging by using JSON.stringify to get more details about the event objects:

This will give us much more detailed information about the touch events, including coordinates, force, timing, and identifiers. Check the console after these changes.

After reviewing the code and logs, I can see the issue. The error "Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener invocation" indicates that our touch event handling is being affected by passive event listeners. We need to modify the touch event handling in the tooltip component. Here's the fix:

client/src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx
The changes:

Removed complex logging that wasn't helping
Added e.preventDefault() to properly handle touch events
Simplified the event handlers
Increased timeout to 2000ms for better usability
Removed e.stopPropagation() which was causing issues
Try testing now - the tooltip should appear when tapped and stay visible for 2 seconds before closing.

while it's redeploying, can you tell me if this 500 error is in any way potentially causing or impacting the tooltip problems we're experiencing?

SS

sswiderek
Assistant
8 hours ago
No, the favicon.ico 500 error is unrelated to the tooltip touch event issues. The tooltip problems we're seeing are related to the passive event listener behavior in modern browsers, which is a client-side JavaScript concern. The 500 error for the favicon is a server-side issue that only affects the browser's attempt to load the site icon.

The "Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener invocation" warnings are the relevant errors for the tooltip behavior, and we've already addressed those with the recent changes to the tooltip component.

The favicon 500 error could be fixed by either adding a favicon.ico file to the correct location or updating the server routes to handle the favicon request properly, but it won't impact the tooltip functionality.

Look at the console logs on the right and tell me what you see

SS

sswiderek
Assistant
8 hours ago
I see several important things in the console logs:

The main issue is multiple "Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener invocation" errors. This is a common browser warning that occurs when trying to prevent default touch behavior in mobile browsers.

There's also a 500 error for favicon.ico, but this is unrelated to the touch event issues.

These errors suggest that the touch event handling in the tooltip component isn't working as expected on mobile devices. The "passive event listener" warnings indicate that the browser is enforcing passive touch events for performance reasons, which is causing conflicts with our attempt to prevent default touch behavior.

Let me propose another approach to fix the tooltip component:

SS

sswiderek

1 minute ago
Based on the analysis, although quite verbose, there are two key insights:

The tooltip element has no direct event listeners attached, suggesting event delegation is used (which is correct since we're using Radix UI's tooltip component)
The next sibling has pointer-events: none which could affect tooltip behavior
Let's update the tooltip component to handle touch events more directly using onTouchStart instead of onTouchEnd, and ensure pointer events are enabled:

client/src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx
These changes:

Switch to onTouchStart for more immediate response
Explicitly enable pointer-events on the trigger
Ensure the target element also has pointer-events enabled when clicked
