I want to implement a new feature that displays the global monthly average price of Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil (VLSFO). I need to retrieve the average price for the previous month (e.g., if today is March 1st, I want February’s monthly average). Please fetch this data from Ship & Bunker’s Global 20 Ports Average or a similar reliable public source.

Objective:
Query OpenAI to retrieve the previous month’s global average VLSFO price.
Example: On March 1st, I need the February global average.
Format the response as "Global VLSFO Price: $603/MT (February 2025)".
Error Handling: Use the last available price if no new data is found.
Clarify the Date: Ensure that the response always includes the correct month and year for the price.
Query Example:
"What was the global monthly average price of Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) for February 2025 according to Ship & Bunker’s Global 20 Ports Average?"

Ensure the date is accurate and reflects the previous month (not the current month).
Return the price in USD/MT."
UI/UX Design for the Calculator
You want a clean, sharp design that’s informative but not cluttered. Here’s how you can improve it:

UI Layout and Design Enhancements:
Fuel Price Display Section

Add a dedicated section at the top for the current global average VLSFO price.

Example:

Copy
Edit
Current Global VLSFO Price: $603/MT (February 2025)  
Based on the Global 20 Ports Average
Tooltip/Icon for More Info:
Add an info icon (ℹ️) next to the price with a tooltip:
"We use the global monthly average price for accuracy. This value updates on the 1st of each month based on data from the previous month."

Fuel Price Field (Optional Pre-Fill)

Auto-populate the Fuel Price (USD/MT) field with the global average fetched from OpenAI.
Allow users to manually adjust it if they want to input a different value.
Display a hint below the field:
"Default price: $603/MT (February 2025). Adjust as needed."
Error Handling in UI

If OpenAI fails to retrieve the price, show a fallback message:
"Price temporarily unavailable; using last known global average ($590/MT for January 2025)."
Consistent Visual Style:

Keep the UI minimal with soft color contrasts (e.g., blue and white).
Use cards or sections to separate the calculator inputs from the fetched information.
Summary Section (Post Calculation)

After calculating savings, add a summary card that includes:
Potential Savings
Assumed Fuel Price (with a note if it’s the global average or custom value).
