Okay, we've finally managed to gather some data about the element, its parent, child, and next sibling. It seems that none of these elements have any event listeners directly attached to them, according to the __listeners property. This suggests that the tooltip functionality might be handled by a delegated event listener higher up in the DOM tree or by some other mechanism. The fact that the tooltips work on hover but not on tap indicates that the logic for showing the tooltips is likely tied to the hover event, which doesn't translate directly to touch events. Also, the next sibling has pointer-events: none, which means that it will not receive any pointer events. This could be a problem if the tooltip is rendered inside the next sibling.
